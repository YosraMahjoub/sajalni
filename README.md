##  Development of a web application for validation of telephone device registration.

This project consists of the realization of an application that allows processing and validating requests for adding a phone device imported via the post office and passed through the border offices.


To guarantee protection against the phenomenon of cell phone theft, the customer must first go to the Border Office as soon as he receives a notification of a package. The agent of the border office then enters the file of the phones and the customer proceeds to register them on the application site. Finally, the technical controller studies the imported applications one by one and makes a decision for each of them, he accepts the application and therefore the phones will be allowed to communicate on the public telecommunications networks, or refuses it and therefore the phones will be blocked and forbidden to access the operators' services.
